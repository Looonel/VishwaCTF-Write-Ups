## Solving Steps

<div style="text-align: justify">There is supposed to be a wav file but I couldn't upload it to github. But anyways, after reading the the description I immidietly knew this was going to be morse code. So I opened up the file in Adobe Premiere Pro (don't judge, I don't have any other audio opening softwares). Zooming into the wav file, you'll see that it looks like morse code.</div><br>

<div style="text-align: justify">So I replicated the morse code structure into a <a href="https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html">morse code translator</a> and sure enough, it was the flag.</div><br>
